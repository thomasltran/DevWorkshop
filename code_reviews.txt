The comments consisting of this code review seems especially helpful to the original poster because of how concise, detailed, and clear they were. For instance, the reviewers commonly quoted the original code in code blocks when referring to aspects of it. Additionally, the reviews connected back to principles of programming such as DRY, proper parameters, flexibility of programs, and more in order to help the poster better understand how to improve their code, rather than just giving the answer outright.

The comments on this code are all telling the author different methods to do it instead of how the author initially implemented it. This isn’t really a great code review because they are all different solutions. It does point out some errors the author made, but each comment isn’t really super helpful to the author.
